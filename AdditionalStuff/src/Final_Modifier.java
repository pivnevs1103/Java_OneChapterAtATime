         - When using the final modifier, you prevent any further modifications to that component;
            - A final method means it cant be overridden by subclass
            - a final field means an objects field cant be reassigned or given a different value, after its
            initialization
            - a final static field is a class field that cant be reassigned, or given a different value, after the
            class initialization process
            - a final class cant be overridden, meaning no class can use it, in the extends clause
            - a final variable, in a block of code, means that once its assigned a value, any remaining code in the
            block cant change it
            - a final method parameter means, we cant assign a different value to that parameter in the method code block
