    Polymorphism:
    - Many forms
    - it lets us write code to call a method, but at runtime, this methods behavior can be different, for different
    objects
    - This means the behavior that occurs, while the program is executing, depends on the runtime type of the object
    - and the runtime type, might be different from the declared type in the code
    - The declared type has to have some kind of relationship to the runtime type, and inheritance is one way
    to establish this relationship
