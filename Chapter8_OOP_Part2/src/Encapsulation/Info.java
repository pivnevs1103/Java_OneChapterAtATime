        In java, encapsulation means hiding things, by making them private or inaccessible

        Why do we want to hide?
        - To make the interface simpler, we may want to hide unnecessary details
        - to protect the integrity of data on an object, we may hide or restrict access to some of the data and
        operations
        - to decouple the published interface from the internal details of the class, we may hide the actual names
        and types of class members
