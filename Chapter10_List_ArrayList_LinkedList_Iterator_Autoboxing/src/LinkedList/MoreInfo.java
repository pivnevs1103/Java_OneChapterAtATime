    - Linked list is a doubly linked list
    - Both implement all of Lists methods, but the LinkedList also implements the Queue and the Stack methods as well

    A Queue_
    - First in, First out(FIFO) Data Collection
    - !!! POLL -> removes from head
    - !!! OFFER -> inserts at tail
    - think of it as standing line
    - If you want to remove an item, you poll the queue, getting the first element or person in the line
    - If you want to add an item, you offer it onto the queue, sending it to the back of the line
    - Single ended queues always process elements from the start of the queue
    - a double-ended queue allows access to both the start and end of the queue

   A Stack_
   - Last in, First out(LIFE) Data Collection
   - think of it as a vertical pule of elements, one on top of another
   - !!! PUSH -> inserts at top of stack
   - !!! POP -> removes from top of stack
   -
