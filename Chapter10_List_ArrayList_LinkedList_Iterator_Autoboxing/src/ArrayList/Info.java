                        So what is a list?
        - List is a special type in Java, called an Interface
        - List interface describes a set of method signatures, that all List classes are expected to have

        Known List of classes that implements this:
            - AbstractList
            - ArrayList
            - LinkedList
            - Stack
            - Vector
            - and etc..(The rest can be seen in a Java API)

        Similar to Arrays there are methods such ass
            - add()
            - contains()
            - indexOf()
            - and etc... the rest can be seen in Java API

         THE ARRAYLIST:
         - the arrayList is a class, that really maintains an array in memory, thats actually bigger than
            what we need, in most cases
         - it keeps track of the capacity, which is the actual size of the array in memory
         - But it also keeps track of the elements that've been assigned or set, which is the size of the ArrayList
         - As elements are added to an ArrayList, its capacity may need to grow. This all happens automatically, behind
            the scenes
